									<p style="color: #F8F8F8; font-family: arial; font-size:17px;">Science fiction can be an extremely underrated genre. People tend to disregard it as not serious enough, not universal enough, or just mediocre entertainment. People look down on stories about made-up planets and alien species, deeming that they’re not relatable. However, it seems to me that these alien stories can sometimes portray humanity even better than other non- science fiction stories. After all, that is what science fiction movies do; “[they] reflect world- wide anxieties, and [...] allay them” (Sontag, 42). This is one of the arguments that Susan Sontag makes in her 1965 essay The Imagination of Disaster. Sontag believes that fantasy stories have two possible effects on their audience: They can serve as an escape and/or distraction from our regular lives, or they can actually “normalize what is psychologically unbearable” (Sontag, 42). In her essay, Sontag also breaks down three sorts of formulas that science fiction movies tend to follow. Even if these typical examples were based on movies before 1965, they are still completely applicable to the science fiction movies we see today.</p>

									<p style="color: #F8F8F8; font-family: arial; font-size:17px;">Hollywood right now has not been very innovative. Most of what is playing in theaters is a sequel, prequel or remake, and the original content tends to be average at best. As a person that really enjoys the movie-going experience, this is very disappointing. However, in January of this year, I went with a friend to watch Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival. I didn’t really know what to expect, but after watching the trailer it seemed interesting enough. I left the theater speechless. Talking to my friends after, I couldn’t recommend it enough. When asked what the film was about, I gave the following synopsis: One day, twelve alien vessels land on different parts of planet Earth. The movie follows Dr. Louise Banks, a linguistics professor who is approached by the US military in order to attempt to establish contact with these aliens and to ask them what their purpose on Earth was. After hearing this, most of them were confused as to why I thought it was so great, since that summary seems like any other alien invasion movie. Yes, it is an alien invasion movie, but unlike anything I had seen before.</p>

									<p style="color: #F8F8F8; font-family: arial; font-size:17px;">The message this film leaves the audience with is that knowing the future doesn't really affect things, and that the experience is what truly has meaning in our lives. It’s a powerful and tragically beautiful ending, because it’s about something that is psychologically unbearable yet amazing in a way. It shows the story of a woman that will lose her daughter no matter what she does, but she would much rather feel the love a mother has for her child, than to not experience that at all. Arrival is not a disaster movie, or another alien invasion movie, it is a movie about what it means to be human.</p>
